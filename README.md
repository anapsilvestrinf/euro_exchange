## Introduction
In this project, we will work with daily data that describes the Euro exchange rate between 1999 and 2021. This dataset is available for download [here](https://www.kaggle.com/lsind18/euro-exchange-daily-rates-19992020).

Our goal is to create a storytelling data visualization on the exchange rate between the euro and the American dollar.
